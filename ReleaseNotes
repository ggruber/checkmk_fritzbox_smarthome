# known issues
v2.0.1
* the option to allow the display of HANFUNunit devices does not work for discovery
  effectivly it's implemented incompletely
* temperatur is shown twice for thermostat devices (comes so from raw api data)
* for thermostat devices there are two mechanisms of battery warning implemented:
  the orignal batterylow warning as given from the Fritz!Box and
  a configurable threshold check
* so possibly more options should become hideable by configuration
